## What is a nifti file?
A NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) file is a widely used format in neuroimaging for storing and sharing neuroimaging data, such as MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and other types of brain imaging data.

NIfTI files can contain volumetric data representing different aspects of brain imaging, such as structural information (e.g., T1-weighted, T2-weighted images), functional information (e.g., fMRI - functional MRI), diffusion imaging (e.g., DTI - Diffusion Tensor Imaging).

## The read_nifti_file_function

This function loads a nifti file from your local computer. If the file you chose is not compatible it will raise an error. 

```python
# Importing the function from utils.py
from utils import read_nifti_file

# Using the function to load a NIfTI file
file_path = 'path/to/your/nifti_file.nii.gz'
loaded_image = read_nifti_file(file_path)

if loaded_image is not None:
    # Process the loaded NIfTI image here
    print("NIfTI file loaded successfully!")
    # Example: Access header information
    header = loaded_image.header
    print(header)
else:
    print("Failed to load NIfTI file.")
